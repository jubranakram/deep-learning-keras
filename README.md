# _Advanced deep learning with Keras_ by Rowel Atienza (2018)

## Summary

This repository contains slightly modified version of code examples from Rowel Atienza's book on "Advanced Deep Learning with Keras". I've rewritten parts of the code as set of functions completing specic tasks.

## Dependencies

`TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`

## Dataset

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset

## Examples

### Chapter 1

- Explore MNIST dataset (`ex_001_pg_7.py`)
- Feedforward neural network (`ex_002_pg_10.py`)
- Convolutional neural network (`ex_003_pg_24.py`)
- Recurrent neural network (`ex_004_pg_31.py`)
