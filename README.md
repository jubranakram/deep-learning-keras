# _Advanced deep learning with Keras_ by Rowel Atienza (2018)

## Summary

This repository contains code examples modified from Rowel Atienza's book on "Advanced Deep Learning with Keras". I've rewritten parts of the code as set of functions completing specic tasks.

## Dependencies

`TensorFlow`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`

## Dataset

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset

## Examples
